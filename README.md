# Enhancing-Product-Recommendations-through-Content-Based-Filtering-
This study explores the development and evaluation of a content-based filtering recommendation system designed to enhance personalized product suggestions using customer purchase history and reviews. Implemented in R and visualized in Power BI, the system utilizes product attributes such as category, brand, and price to recommend items. The research aims to assess the model's performance in sparse data conditions and its ability to handle new products while ensuring diversity in recommendations. Our findings demonstrate that content-based filtering, when combined with dynamic visualization tools, offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world e-commerce environments.
